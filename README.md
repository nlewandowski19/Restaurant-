This is a five-page website I built for my made up Italian restaurant. I used HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and a bit of JavaScript. The goal was to make a fully functional and responsive website that looks clean, 
has good user experience, and hits all the class requirements. 
Pages I Included Home: With carousel, intro text, and logo About Us: Tells the story of how the restaurant started Contact Us: has a Google Form, Menu Pages: One for lunch, one for dinner, and one for drinks/desserts 
Each page has 250+ words and at least 3 images What I Used HTML, Bootstrap 5 (rows, columns, carousel, nav dropdowns) Google Fonts Responsive design A Google Form for contact Tables and lists for menu pages SEO elements like title tags, meta descriptions, and image alt text Design Choices I wanted to keep it simple and clean 
The fonts and colors are easy to read. I made sure the site works on phones and desktops. I focused on layout, visuals,and keeping everything consistent. 
The hardest part was getting the Bootstrap carousel and nav bar to cooperate. Making sure every page hit the 250-word requirement without repeating too much, making my tables line up correctly and look good on mobile.
Final Thoughts I'm happy with how it came out. It looks solid and works on different screen sizes. I feel like I hit all the requirements and itâ€™s something I could use further down the road or even for broadcasting my work.
